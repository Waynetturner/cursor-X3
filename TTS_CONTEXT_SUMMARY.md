# TTS Context Summary for X3 Momentum Pro

## Context Detection Fixed

### Exercise Transition (after exercises 1, 2, 3)
- **Context**: Between exercises during the same workout
- **Messages**: Uses `getExerciseTransitionPhrase()` 
- **Example**: "Chest Press complete! Take a breath and prepare for Tricep Press."
- **Triggers**: When `nextIndex < exercises.length` (not the last exercise)

### Workout Completion (after exercise 4)
- **Context**: After the final exercise of the workout
- **Messages**: Uses `getWorkoutCompletionPhrase()`
- **Example**: "Outstanding! You've completed your Push workout for today. Tomorrow will be a Pull day."
- **Triggers**: When `nextIndex >= exercises.length` (last exercise)

### Rest Period Countdown (90-second timer)
- **Context**: During rest period between exercises
- **Messages**: Precise timing coordination
- **Triggers**: Only between exercises (not after final exercise)

## Precise Timing Implementation

### Rest Timer Countdown Sequence:
1. **At 90 seconds**: "Get ready for [NEXT EXERCISE] in"
2. **At 88 seconds**: "one"
3. **At 86 seconds**: "two" 
4. **At 84 seconds**: "three" + Start cadence
5. **At 8 seconds**: Cadence continues until timer ends

### Timing Coordination:
- Lead-in phrase starts at 90s (estimated 4-6 seconds duration)
- Individual countdown numbers at precise 2-second intervals
- Cadence starts after "three" to avoid audio overlap
- All timing logged to console for verification

## Console Logging Added:

### Context Detection:
```
🎯 Context Detection: Exercise 2 of 4 (Tricep Press)
🎯 Next index: 2, Is last exercise: false
🔄 TTS Context: EXERCISE TRANSITION
🔄 Transitioning from Tricep Press to Overhead Press
🔄 Speaking transition phrase: "Tricep Press complete! Take a breath and prepare for Overhead Press."
```

### Precise Timing:
```
⏰ Rest timer at 90s for next exercise: Overhead Press
⏰ TTS: Speaking lead-in phrase at 90s: "Get ready for Overhead Press in"
⏰ TTS: Speaking "one" at exactly 88 seconds
⏰ TTS: Speaking "two" at exactly 86 seconds
⏰ TTS: Speaking "three" at exactly 84 seconds
🎵 Starting cadence for next exercise prep after countdown
```

## Fixed Issues:
- ✅ Context detection now properly distinguishes transitions vs completion
- ✅ Precise countdown timing implemented (88s, 86s, 84s)
- ✅ Lead-in phrase calculated to end before countdown
- ✅ Comprehensive console logging for verification
- ✅ No more "great workout" messages after exercise 2
