# WebLLM AI Coach Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated WebLLM (client-side LLM) as the primary AI coach system for X3 Momentum Pro, with intelligent fallback to the existing n8n webhook system.

## ‚úÖ Components Implemented

### 1. **X3 Knowledge Base** (`src/lib/x3-knowledge-base.ts`)
- **Comprehensive Exercise Database**: Complete push/pull exercise catalog with form cues, common mistakes, and progressions
- **X3 Core Principles**: Variable resistance, time under tension, train-to-failure methodology  
- **Band Progression System**: White ‚Üí Light Gray ‚Üí Gray ‚Üí Dark Gray ‚Üí Black with resistance ranges
- **Program Structure**: Week 1-4 adaptation phase, Week 5+ intensification phase
- **Coaching Response Templates**: Motivation, form, progression, and recovery coaching phrases
- **Context-Aware Advice Generator**: Generates coaching advice based on current exercise, week, band color, and user question

### 2. **WebLLM Coach Hook** (`src/hooks/useWebLLMCoach.ts`)
- **Model Integration**: Uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC for local inference
- **Context Management**: Loads user workout history, stats, and current session data from Supabase
- **Dynamic System Prompts**: Injects X3 knowledge base + user context into each conversation
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains recent chat history for contextual responses
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully falls back to knowledge base responses if WebLLM fails
- **Auto-initialization**: Automatically loads when user ID is provided

### 3. **Enhanced CoachChat Component** (`src/components/CoachChat/CoachChat.tsx`)
- **Intelligent AI Selection**: 
  - üß† **Local AI** (WebLLM) - Primary choice when available
  - ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud AI** (n8n webhook) - Fallback when WebLLM not ready
  - üß™ **Test Mode** - Mock responses for development
- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - üü¢ "Local AI" - WebLLM ready and active
  - üü° "Loading AI" - WebLLM initializing 
  - üîµ "Cloud AI" - Using n8n webhook
- **Context Injection**: Automatically provides current exercise, workout type, week, and user stats to AI
- **TTS Integration**: Voice responses work with both AI systems
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of AI failures with helpful fallback messages

## üß† AI Coach Capabilities

### **X3-Specific Knowledge** ‚úÖ CORRECTED METHODOLOGY
- **15-40 Rep Range**: Each exercise performed once to complete failure (NOT sets)
- **Band Progression Rules**: 
  - <15 reps = move down a band (except White - stay and build strength)
  - >40 reps = move up to heavier band
  - 15-40 reps = optimal range, continue with partial reps after failure
- **Variable Resistance Principles**: 7x more activation than traditional weights
- **Form Coaching**: 4-second positive/negative, time under tension focus
- **NO Traditional Weightlifting**: Never suggests sets, rest periods, or 8-12 rep ranges

### **Personalized Context**
- User's workout history and performance trends from Supabase
- Current exercise performance (full reps, partial reps, band selection)
- Workout progression (current week, exercise completion status)
- Subscription tier and available features

### **Intelligent X3-Specific Responses**
- **Form Coaching**: "For Chest Press with Gray band, focus on controlled 4-second negatives and train to failure between 15-40 reps, then continue with partial range reps."
- **Progression Advice**: "With 42 reps on the Gray band, you're ready to progress to Dark Gray for optimal muscle challenge in the 15-40 rep range."
- **Motivation**: "Your consistency is paying off! Training to failure, not to a number - that's the X3 way!"
- **Problem Solving**: "If you're getting <15 reps, consider moving down to Light Gray band. Remember, X3 isn't about traditional sets - it's one continuous effort to failure."

## üîÑ Fallback System

### **Priority Order:**
1. **WebLLM Local AI** (when ready and available)
2. **n8n Cloud Webhook** (when WebLLM not ready/failed)
3. **Knowledge Base Responses** (when both AI systems fail)
4. **Generic Encouragement** (ultimate fallback)

### **Seamless User Experience:**
- Users see real-time status of which AI system is active
- No interruption in coaching during system switches
- Consistent X3-focused responses regardless of AI backend

## üì± User Interface

### **Chat Header Indicators:**
- **üß† Local AI**: WebLLM running locally (fastest, most private)
- **‚è≥ Loading AI**: WebLLM initializing (downloading/loading model)
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud AI**: Using n8n webhook (reliable fallback)
- **üîä Voice**: TTS audio cues available

### **Smart Features:**
- Auto-focus input when chat opens
- Message timestamps and TTS replay buttons
- Character counter (500 char limit)
- Minimize/maximize and close controls
- Auto-scroll to newest messages

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **WebLLM Model Loading:**
```typescript
// Dynamic import to avoid SSR issues
const { MLCEngine } = await import('@mlc-ai/web-llm')
const engine = new MLCEngine()
await engine.reload("Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC")
```

### **Context-Aware System Prompts:**
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert X3 fitness coach...
## User's Current Context:
- Total Workouts: ${userStats.totalWorkouts}
- Current Exercise: ${currentExercise.name}
- Band: ${currentExercise.band}
- Performance: ${currentExercise.fullReps} full reps, ${currentExercise.partialReps} partial reps
...`
```

### **Intelligent Fallback Logic:**
```typescript
if (webLLMCoach.isReady && webLLMCoach.canGenerate) {
  // Use WebLLM
} else {
  // Fallback to n8n webhook
}
```

## üîç Testing

### **Test Scenarios:**
1. **WebLLM Ready**: Ask exercise-specific questions, verify X3 knowledge responses
2. **WebLLM Loading**: Check "Loading AI" indicator and n8n fallback
3. **Network Issues**: Verify graceful fallback to knowledge base responses
4. **Context Injection**: Test with different exercises, bands, and workout contexts
5. **TTS Integration**: Verify voice responses work with both AI systems
