## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-11

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Calendar Timezone Synchronization

#### Calendar Timezone Issue Resolution
- **Fixed Critical Calendar Bug** - Resolved timezone synchronization issue causing calendar to display workout sequence one day ahead
- **Root Cause Identified** - All date calculations used UTC time instead of user's local timezone, causing calendar to show 8/11 when user was in 8/10 timezone
- **Existing Infrastructure Utilized** - Leveraged existing `profiles.timezone` and `workout_local_date_time` columns that were previously unused in calendar calculations

#### Technical Improvements
- **getUserToday() Pattern** - Established timezone-aware helper function for all future date calculations
- **Dynamic Calendar Calculations** - Removed dependency on pre-filled database entries, calendar now calculates workouts dynamically
- **Multi-User Timezone Support** - Each user's timezone handled individually from their profile settings
- **Developer Guidelines** - Documented timezone-aware development patterns for future sessions

#### Files Modified (18 total)
- `src/lib/daily-workout-log.ts` - Major timezone fixes and getUserToday() helper function
- `src/app/calendar/page.tsx` - Updated to use timezone-aware calculations  
- `src/lib/user-stats.ts` - Updated to use new daily log functions
- `src/lib/services/workout-service.ts` - Fixed TypeScript validation issues
- 14+ additional files with timezone pattern updates

#### User Impact
- **Calendar Accuracy** - Calendar now displays correct workout sequence in user's local timezone
- **Dashboard Sync** - Dashboard status correctly synchronized with calendar display  
- **Future Reliability** - Established patterns prevent similar timezone issues in future development
