# Daily Workout Log Implementation Status

## What We've Created

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250806_create_daily_workout_log.sql`
- **Purpose**: Creates the `daily_workout_log` table with proper indexes and RLS policies
- **Status**: Ready to apply

### 2. Backfill Script
- **File**: `src/lib/backfill-daily-workout-log.ts`
- **Purpose**: Populates historical data from workout_exercises table
- **Features**:
  - Processes workout history from user's start date
  - Correctly identifies Push/Pull/Rest/Missed days
  - Handles schedule shifting when workouts are missed
  - Special handling for Wayne's pre-7/30 data (Rest instead of Missed)
  - 8-day consecutive miss reset rule

### 3. Daily Workout Log Service
- **File**: `src/lib/daily-workout-log.ts`
- **Purpose**: Functions to interact with the new table
- **Functions**:
  - `getTodaysWorkoutFromLog()` - Get today's scheduled workout
  - `updateDailyWorkoutLog()` - Update when workout is completed
  - `markMissedWorkouts()` - Mark past scheduled workouts as missed
  - `calculateStreakFromLog()` - Calculate accurate streaks
  - `getWorkoutForDateFromLog()` - Get workout for any date

### 4. Documentation
- **File**: `docs/DAILY_WORKOUT_LOG_MIGRATION.md`
- **Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for applying the migration

## Next Steps (After Migration)

### 1. Apply the Migration
Follow the steps in `DAILY_WORKOUT_LOG_MIGRATION.md` to:
- Create the table in Supabase
- Run the backfill script with your user ID

### 2. Update Calendar Page
- Modify `src/app/calendar/page.tsx` to read from `daily_workout_log`
- Remove complex date calculations
- Show accurate Push/Pull/Rest/Missed status

### 3. Update Dashboard
- Modify `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to use `getTodaysWorkoutFromLog()`
- Ensure it matches what Calendar shows

### 4. Update Workout Save Function
- Modify workout save to also update `daily_workout_log`
- Call `updateDailyWorkoutLog()` when workout is completed
- Handle missed workout detection

### 5. Update Stats Page
- Use `calculateStreakFromLog()` for accurate streaks
- Show more detailed statistics from complete daily records

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Both Calendar and Dashboard read the same data
2. **Accurate History**: Every day has a record showing what happened
3. **Proper Scheduling**: Workouts shift forward when missed, rest days stay in position
4. **Better Coaching**: Complete data for pattern recognition and recommendations
5. **Simpler Code**: No more complex date calculations scattered throughout
