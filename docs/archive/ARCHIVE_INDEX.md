## New Documentation Structure

The archived content has been reorganized into 5 comprehensive guides:

1. **CURRENT_STATE.md** - Complete application overview, architecture, and current status
2. **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Development setup, workflow, standards, and best practices
3. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Technical API reference, hooks, services, and integrations
4. **FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md** - User-facing features, workflows, and subscription tiers
5. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and development timeline

- **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each topic
- **Improved Navigation**: Clear cross-references between documents
- **Current Focus**: Emphasis on current state rather than historical issues
