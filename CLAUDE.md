### 📋 **Technical Patterns & Standards**

#### **Test Mode Usage**
```typescript
// Check if in test mode
if (testModeService.shouldMockWorkouts()) {
  // Use mock data instead of database
}

// Enable test mode in Advanced settings
testModeService.enable()
```

#### **TTS Integration**
```typescript
// Use TTS hook with loading states
const { speak, isLoading, error, getSourceIndicator } = useX3TTS()

// Speak with automatic fallback and context
await speak("Your motivational message here", 'exercise')
```

#### **Timezone Handling**
```typescript
import { getCurrentCentralISOString } from '@/lib/timezone'

// Always use Central time for consistency
const timestamp = getCurrentCentralISOString()
```

#### **Save Operations with Loading States**
```typescript
// Set loading state
setSaveLoadingStates(prev => ({ ...prev, [index]: true }))

try {
  // Perform save operation
  const result = await supabase.from('table').insert(data)
  
  // Handle success
  setSaveLoadingStates(prev => ({ ...prev, [index]: false }))
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error with user feedback
  setSaveErrorStates(prev => ({ ...prev, [index]: errorMessage }))
  setSaveLoadingStates(prev => ({ ...prev, [index]: false }))
}
```

#### **Coach Chat Integration**
```typescript
// Import and use Coach Chat component
import CoachChat from '@/components/CoachChat/CoachChat'

// Integrate with workout context
<CoachChat
  currentExercise={{
    name: "Chest Press",
    band: "Black", 
    fullReps: 12,
    partialReps: 6,
    notes: "User notes"
  }}
  workoutContext={{
    workoutType: "Push",
    week: 3,
    exercisesCompleted: 1,
    totalExercises: 4
  }}
/>
```
