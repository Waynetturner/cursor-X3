# Fix Workout Scheduling to Use Completion-Based Week Progression

This PR implements a true completion-based workout week progression system that ensures:

1. Weeks only advance when ALL 7 workouts are completed (Push/Pull/Push/Pull/Push/Pull/Rest)
2. Consecutive weeks do NOT begin until the previous week is fully completed
3. Missed workouts prevent week advancement until caught up

## Problem Fixed

The workout scheduling system was incorrectly showing Rest on 8/5 when it should show Push. This happened because the system was using calendar-based week calculations instead of tracking actual workout completions.

## Implementation Details

- Replaced calendar-based week calculations with true completion-based logic
- Implemented comprehensive tracking of workout completions to determine week progression
- Added detailed documentation to prevent future regressions
- Integrated with existing adaptive scheduling infrastructure

## Testing

Added a test script (`test-completion-logic.js`) that verifies the completion-based logic works correctly. The test confirms that today (8/5) shows Push workout instead of Rest, which matches the user's expectation.
